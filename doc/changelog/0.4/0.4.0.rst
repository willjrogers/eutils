Removed time-based throttling and added support for NCBI API
keys. Without an API key, NCBI returns an error if clients make more
than 3 requests/second. With an API, clients may make 10
requests/second. See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25497/. The
API key may be passed as argument to :ref:`Client` and QueryService.
